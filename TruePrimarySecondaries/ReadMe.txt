[h1]Experimental new version of Primary Secondaries[/h1]

Please read the description before using this mod!

This mod requires the WotC Highlander and the Ability To Slot Reassignment mod to work. Dont skip the required items!
Dont run this mod together with the old PrimarySecondaries mod. If you use this one deactivate the old one.

So what is the difference to the old Primary Secondaries you might ask yourself.

The old Primary Secondaries mod is generating primary versions of secondary weapon templates. This resulted in some issue like duplicate variants of unique weapons and 
the need of attaching upgrades to primary and secondary weapons separately.
It also caused various issues with mods that have single build items like Covert Infiltration and LWOTC.

The new version allows you to equip the exact same melee weapons and pistols/autopistols in the secondary and primary slot.
So e.g. with this mod if you equip the chosen katana in the primary slot you wont be able to equip it in the secondary slot since you have only one unique item you can equip in either slot.
If you have upgraded a pistol with some weapon upgrades you can now just remove the pistol from a secondary slot of a soldier and give it to another soldier in the primary slot.

Sharpshooter, Rangers, Specialist, Grenadier and PsiOperative are enabled to use primary melee weapons, primary pistols and templar sidearms.

[b][i]Do i need to start a new campaign when switching from the old primary secondaries mod?[/i][/b]
Its recommended, it might work for running campaigns as well but i dont take any responsibility if this causes issues.

[b][i]Do mods that require primary secondaries work with this version as well?[/i][/b]
All of my and iridars like dual wield melee and dual wielded pistols mod are updated to support the new version but keep in mind that this is a experimental BETA so there are probably some bugs and glitches i havent catched yet.

[b][i]RPGO is complaining that it needs Primary Secondaries after i switched to this version[/i][/b]
You can safely ignore that warning for now.
